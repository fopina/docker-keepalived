           --cap-add=NET_RAW \
           --net=host \
           ghcr.io/fopina/keepalived
```

## Usage

Image entrypoint is `keepalived` itself with flags `-n -l`: run in foreground (as it is a container) and log to console

```
docker run --rm ghcr.io/fopina/keepalived -h
Usage: keepalived [OPTION...]
  -f, --use-file=FILE          Use the specified configuration file
...
